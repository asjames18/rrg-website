## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database Setup** (Required First)

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of CMS_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
-- This creates all the new tables for the CMS
```

**Important:** This will create new tables alongside your existing ones. Your current content will remain safe.

### 2. **Storage Setup** (For Media Files)

In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **Storage** → **Buckets**
2. Create a new bucket called `media`
3. Set it to **Public**
4. Add this RLS policy:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to media files
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for media" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload media" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'media' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete their own uploads
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own media" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE USING (bucket_id = 'media' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```
