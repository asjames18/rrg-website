## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### **Admin Secret**
The admin promotion tool uses this secret:
- **Secret**: `rrg-admin-2024`
- **Location**: `/admin-promote` page

### **First Admin Account**
Since you need at least one admin to start:
1. Create your account at `/auth`
2. Use `/admin-promote` to promote yourself
3. Or manually update the database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

---

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If Tables Already Exist**
The SQL uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so it's safe to run multiple times.

### **If You Get Permission Errors**
Make sure you're running the SQL as the database owner (usually the case in Supabase).

### **If RLS Policies Don't Work**
Check that RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public';
```

### **If Profile Creation Fails**
Check the trigger:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

## ‚úÖ **Verification Checklist**

After running the SQL, verify:

- [ ] Can create new user accounts at `/auth`
- [ ] New users get `viewer` role automatically
- [ ] Can promote users to admin at `/admin-promote`
- [ ] Admin users can access `/admin-dashboard`
- [ ] Regular users cannot access admin routes
