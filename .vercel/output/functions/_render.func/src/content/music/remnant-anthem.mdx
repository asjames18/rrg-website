## About This Song

**Remnant Anthem** is a declaration of identity for those who refuse to compromise. It's a battle cry for the last-days believers who walk in holiness, honor the sacred Names, and stand firm in the face of opposition.

## Lyrics

*Verse 1:*  
We are the remnant, called and set apart  
Fire in our spirit, YAHUAH in our heart  
No more religion, no more playing games  
We speak the truth and honor His Name  

*Chorus:*  
YAHUSHA is King, the Lion has roared  
We take up our cross, we unsheathe the sword  
The enemy trembles when we stand and fight  
Covered in His blood, walking in the light  

*Verse 2:*  
They call us radical, they say we've gone too far  
But we won't bow to Babylon or follow a fallen star  
We keep the Feasts, we guard the door  
We're soldiers of the King, we're made for war  

*Bridge:*  
By His blood we overcome  
By the word of our testimony  
We love not our lives unto death  
We are the remnant, we have no fear left  

## Musical Style

Powerful, anthemic worship with a war room edge. Think Hillsong meets hardcore—unapologetic, bold, and drenched in the RUACH HAQODESH.

## Inspiration

This song was born out of frustration with watered-down worship. We needed a sound that matched the intensity of these last days. A sound that calls believers to **wake up, stand up, and fight**.

## Scripture Foundation

- **Revelation 12:11** - "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death."
- **Romans 8:37** - "Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."
- **2 Timothy 2:3** - "You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."

## Use This Song
