Real & Raw Gospel respects your privacy. We are committed to protecting any personal information you share with us 
        and being transparent about our data practices.
</p> <h2>Information We Collect</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
Currently, this website does not collect personal information unless you voluntarily provide it 
        (e.g., through contact forms, newsletter signups, or other interactive features if implemented in the future).
</p> <h2>Third-Party Embeds</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
We use minimal third-party embeds to enhance your experience:
</p> <ul class="text-neutral-300"> <li><strong>Video Players:</strong> We may embed videos from YouTube (using youtube-nocookie.com for privacy), 
        TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. These platforms may collect data according to their own privacy policies.</li> <li><strong>Audio Content:</strong> Audio files are hosted locally and do not involve third-party tracking.</li> </ul> <p class="text-neutral-300">
We choose privacy-respecting options whenever possible (such as YouTube's no-cookie domain). 
        However, embedded content from third parties may still use cookies or collect data according to their policies.
</p> <h2>Affiliate Links</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
Our <a href="/books" class="text-amber-400 hover:text-amber-300 underline">Books</a> page and other content may contain affiliate links. 
        When you click these links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.
</p> <p class="text-neutral-300"> <strong>What this means for you:</strong> </p> <ul class="text-neutral-300"> <li>Your price stays the same whether you use our link or not</li> <li>The merchant (e.g., Amazon, other retailers) may track your purchase to credit our account</li> <li>We only recommend resources we genuinely believe will help you grow spiritually</li> <li>Commissions help support this ministry and keep resources free</li> </ul> <h2>Analytics</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
We do not currently use any analytics or tracking services. We don't track your browsing behavior, 
        collect IP addresses, or use cookies for advertising purposes.
</p> <p class="text-neutral-300">
If we implement privacy-respecting analytics in the future (such as aggregated, anonymous usage statistics), 
        we will update this policy accordingly.
</p> <h2>Cookies</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
This website may use essential cookies for basic functionality (e.g., remembering your Bible reader preferences 
        or Sacred Names toggle state). We do not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising cookies.
</p> <h2>External Links</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">
Our website may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., affiliate book links, social media, video platforms). 
        We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.
</p> <h2>Data Security</h2> <p class="text-neutral-300">

        the internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.
