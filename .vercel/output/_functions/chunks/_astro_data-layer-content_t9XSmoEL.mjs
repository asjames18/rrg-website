This handbook strips away centuries of tradition and brings you back to the **Hebrew foundations** of Scripture.\n\n## What You'll Discover\n\n### The Sacred Names\n- Why \"LORD\" isn't a name—it's a title that replaced the Tetragrammaton\n- The true Name of the Father: **YAHUAH**\n- The true Name of the Messiah: **YAHUSHA**\n- The power and significance of speaking His Name\n\n### The Torah Is Not Dead\n- How the law was never abolished—only fulfilled in YAHUSHA\n- What it means to walk in obedience without legalism\n- The difference between Pharisaical tradition and YAHUAH's commands\n\n### The Feasts of YAHUAH\n- Why the biblical calendar matters\n- The prophetic significance of each Feast\n- How to observe them in a modern context\n- The Fall Feasts and the return of YAHUSHA\n\n### Identity & Covenant\n- Who is Israel? (Hint: It's not just about ethnicity)\n- The grafting in of Gentile believers\n- One new man in Mashiach\n\n## Who Should Read This?\n\n- Believers who sense something is missing in traditional Christianity\n- Anyone curious about the Hebrew roots of the faith\n- Those who want to honor YAHUAH with His true Name\n- People seeking to understand the Feasts and biblical calendar\n\n## What Readers Are Saying\n\n*\"This book challenged everything I thought I knew about Christianity. I'm not the same person after reading it.\"*\n\n*\"Finally, a resource that doesn't compromise on truth. The Sacred Names section alone is worth the price.\"*\n\n*\"If you're serious about walking with YAHUAH, you need this book.\"*\n\n## Our Take\n\nThis handbook is a solid introduction to Hebraic roots without the fluff. It's direct, biblically grounded, and practical. \n\n**Fair Warning:** This book will challenge you. If you're comfortable in your current theology, this might shake you. But if you're hungry for truth and willing to be refined, this is essential reading.\n\n---\n\n**Related Topics:**\n- [Feasts of YAH](/feasts) - Learn about the biblical calendar\n- [Identity & Mashiach](/identity-and-messiah) - Your identity in YAHUSHA\n- [Start Here](/start-here) - New to these concepts?

It's a battle cry for the last-days believers who walk in holiness, honor the sacred Names, and stand firm in the face of opposition.\n\n## Lyrics\n\n*Verse 1:*  \nWe are the remnant, called and set apart  \nFire in our spirit, YAHUAH in our heart  \nNo more religion, no more playing games  \nWe speak the truth and honor His Name  \n\n*Chorus:*  \nYAHUSHA is King, the Lion has roared  \nWe take up our cross, we unsheathe the sword  \nThe enemy trembles when we stand and fight  \nCovered in His blood, walking in the light  \n\n*Verse 2:*  \nThey call us radical, they say we've gone too far  \nBut we won't bow to Babylon or follow a fallen star  \nWe keep the Feasts, we guard the door  \nWe're soldiers of the King, we're made for war  \n\n*Bridge:*  \nBy His blood we overcome  \nBy the word of our testimony  \nWe love not our lives unto death  \nWe are the remnant, we have no fear left  \n\n## Musical Style\n\nPowerful, anthemic worship with a war room edge. Think Hillsong meets hardcore—unapologetic, bold, and drenched in the RUACH HAQODESH.\n\n## Inspiration\n\nThis song was born out of frustration with watered-down worship. We needed a sound that matched the intensity of these last days. A sound that calls believers to **wake up, stand up, and fight**.\n\n## Scripture Foundation\n\n- **Revelation 12:11** - \"And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.\"\n- **Romans 8:37** - \"Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.\"\n- **2 Timothy 2:3** - \"You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.\"\n\n## Use This Song\n\n- **Corporate Worship**: Declare victory over the enemy\n- **Personal Prayer Time**: Armor up before you face the day\n- **Spiritual Warfare**: Play it loud when you're in the thick of battle\n- **Encouragement**: When you feel alone, remember—you're part of the remnant\n\n## Download & Licensing\n\nThis song is free for personal use and church worship.

In this teaching, we break down the most common doorways that give the adversary legal access to your life.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\n- **Identifying Open Doors**: Unforgiveness, sexual sin, occult involvement, generational curses\n- **Closing the Access**: Biblical repentance and renunciation\n- **Guarding the Seal**: How to keep doors shut once they're closed\n- **Authority in YAHUSHA**: Using the Name above all names\n\n## Key Points\n\n### 1. Every Doorway Has a Key\nThe enemy can't just barge in. He exploits:\n- Sin you haven't repented of\n- Trauma you haven't surrendered\n- Agreements you've made (knowingly or unknowingly)\n\n### 2. Repentance Closes Doors\nIt's not enough to feel bad about sin. You have to:\n- Confess it (agree with YAHUAH that it's sin)\n- Renounce it (break agreement with darkness)\n- Receive forgiveness (plead the blood of YAHUSHA)\n\n### 3. The Blood Seals It\nOnce you've closed a door, plead the blood of YAHUSHA over it. Command the enemy to leave in YAHUSHA's Name. Then station the RUACH HAQODESH as your guard.\n\n## Watch This If...\n\n- You feel spiritually attacked but don't know why\n- You've repented but still feel oppressed\n- You want to learn how to fight with spiritual authority\n- You're tired of living defensively and want to go on offense\n\n## Action Steps After Watching\n\n1. **Self-Inventory**: Ask the RUACH HAQODESH to reveal open doorways\n2. **Repent Specifically**: Use the micro-liturgy for closing doorways\n3. **Guard Your Life**: Don't reopen what YAHUAH has sealed\n4. **Walk in Authority**: You're not a victim—you're a warrior\n\n---\n\n**Related Resources:**\n- [Prayer & Fasting](/prayer-and-fasting) - Micro-liturgy for closing doorways\n- [Spiritual Warfare](/spiritual-warfare) - Armor of YAHUAH breakdown\n- [Identity & Mashiach](/identity-and-messiah) - Know your authority in YAHUSHA","src/content/videos/shut-the-doorways-warfare-101.mdx","d077300372b34ab9","shut-the-doorways-warfare-101.mdx","blog",["Map",72,73],"keep-the-feast-dump-the-yeast",{id:72,data:74,body:82,filePath:83,digest:84,legacyId:85,deferredRender:29},{title:75,tags:76,summary:79,publishedAt:80,readingTime:81},"Keep the Feast, Dump the Yeast",[24,77,78],"Holiness","Obedience","The Feast of Unleavened Bread isn't a suggestion. It's a command to remove sin from your life. No excuses, no half measures—get the yeast out.",["Date","2025-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"],5,"## Why Unleavened Bread Matters\n\nLeaven represents sin. It puffs up. It spreads. It corrupts the whole lump (1 Corinthians 5:6). \n\nWhen YAHUAH commanded His people to eat unleavened bread for seven days, He wasn't making suggestions. He was establishing a pattern: **separate yourself from sin**.\n\n## The Seven-Day Purge\n\nFor seven days, you remove all leaven from your house. Every crumb. Every trace. \n\nThis is a physical act with spiritual meaning:\n\n1. **Identify the leaven** - What sin is hiding in your life?\n2. **Remove it ruthlessly** - No compromise, no \"just a little\"\n3. **Guard the house** - Stay vigilant so it doesn't return\n\n## Modern Application\n\nWe're not under the law for salvation—we're under grace. But grace doesn't mean license to sin. It means power to overcome.\n\nThe Feast of Unleavened Bread teaches us:\n\n- **Holiness is intentional** - You have to actively remove sin\n- **Small compromises spread** - A little leaven corrupts the whole\n- **Obedience brings freedom** - Living without leaven is living without burden\n\n## The Challenge\n\nThis year, don't just skip Easter and call it done. **Observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread.**\n\n- Fast from a specific sin for seven days\n- Remove ungodly influences from your home (media, relationships, habits)\n- Meditate on YAHUSHA as the Bread of Life—pure, sinless, unleavened\n\nYAHUAH didn't give us the Feasts to burden us. He gave them to train us, refine us, and prepare us for His Kingdom.\n\nKeep the Feast. Dump the yeast. Walk in holiness.\n\n---\n\n**Scripture References:**\n- Exodus 12:15-20 - Command to observe Unleavened Bread\n- 1 Corinthians 5:6-8 - Christ our Passover, purge the leaven\n- Galatians 5:9 - A little leaven corrupts the whole lump","src/content/blog/keep-the-feast-dump-the-yeast.mdx","0090b38c8d15ae24","keep-the-feast-dump-the-yeast.mdx"];
