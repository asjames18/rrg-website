## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Notes**

### **Admin Secret**
- The promotion tool uses a simple secret: `rrg-admin-2024`
- **Change this in production!** Update it in `/src/pages/api/promote-to-admin.ts`
- Consider using environment variables for production

### **Role Hierarchy**
- **Admin**: Full access to everything
- **Editor**: Can create/edit content, manage users
- **Viewer**: Can view content, basic access

### **Best Practices**
1. **Limit admin access** - Only promote trusted users
2. **Use strong passwords** - Especially for admin accounts
3. **Regular audits** - Review who has admin access
4. **Change secrets** - Update admin secrets regularly

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **"User not found" Error**
- Make sure the user has created an account first

- User must have confirmed their email

### **"Invalid admin secret" Error**
- Use the exact secret: `rrg-admin-2024`
- Check for typos or extra spaces

### **Admin Panel Not Showing**
- Sign out and sign back in after promotion
- Check that the role was actually updated in the database
- Clear browser cache if needed

### **Permission Denied Errors**
- Make sure you're using the correct Supabase service role key
- Check that RLS policies are set up correctly
