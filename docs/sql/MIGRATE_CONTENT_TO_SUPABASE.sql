  'The signs YAHUSHA warned about are unfolding before our eyes. Wars, earthquakes, false prophets, persecution. The question isn''t if He''s coming—it''s when.',
  '## The Signs Are Unfolding

YAHUSHA told us to watch. He gave us specific signs to look for. And they''re happening right now:

- **Wars and rumors of wars** (Matthew 24:6)
- **Earthquakes in various places** (Matthew 24:7)
- **False prophets deceiving many** (Matthew 24:11)
- **The love of many growing cold** (Matthew 24:12)
- **The gospel preached to all nations** (Matthew 24:14)

## The Hour is Late

We''re not in the end times—we''re in the last of the last days. The birth pangs are intensifying. The contractions are getting closer together.

**The question isn''t if YAHUSHA is coming back. The question is: are you ready?**

## Watch and Work

YAHUSHA told us to watch and work until He returns. Here''s your assignment:

### Watch
- **Discern the times** - Don''t be caught sleeping
- **Stay alert** - The enemy prowls like a roaring lion
- **Know the signs** - Study Scripture, not social media
- **Pray without ceasing** - Stay connected to YAHUAH

### Work
- **Share the Gospel** - The fields are white for harvest
- **Make disciples** - Train others in the ways of YAHUAH
- **Stand firm** - Don''t compromise when persecution comes
- **Endure to the end** - He who endures will be saved

## The Tribulation is Coming

A time of great tribulation is coming—a time of trouble such as the world has never seen (Matthew 24:21).

But those who call on the Name of YAHUAH will be saved. Those who endure will reign with Him.

## The Return of the King

YAHUSHA is coming back. Not as a suffering servant, but as a conquering King.

- **Every eye will see Him** (Revelation 1:7)
- **The trumpet will sound** (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
- **The dead in Mashiach will rise** (1 Corinthians 15:52)',

  '## Overview

The enemy doesn''t need permission to attack—but he does need an open door. In this teaching, we break down the most common doorways that give the adversary legal access to your life.

## What You''ll Learn

- **Identifying Open Doors**: Unforgiveness, sexual sin, occult involvement, generational curses
- **Closing the Access**: Biblical repentance and renunciation
- **Guarding the Seal**: How to keep doors shut once they''re closed
- **Authority in YAHUSHA**: Using the Name above all names

## Key Points

### 1. Every Doorway Has a Key
The enemy can''t just barge in. He exploits:
- Sin you haven''t repented of
- Trauma you haven''t surrendered
- Agreements you''ve made (knowingly or unknowingly)

### 2. Repentance Closes Doors
It''s not enough to feel bad about sin. You have to:
- Confess it (agree with YAHUAH that it''s sin)
- Renounce it (break agreement with darkness)
- Receive forgiveness (plead the blood of YAHUSHA)

### 3. The Blood Seals It
Once you''ve closed a door, plead the blood of YAHUSHA over it. Command the enemy to leave in YAHUSHA''s Name. Then station the RUACH HAQODESH as your guard.

## Watch This If...

- You feel spiritually attacked but don''t know why
- You''ve repented but still feel oppressed
- You want to learn how to fight with spiritual authority
- You''re tired of living defensively and want to go on offense

## Action Steps After Watching

1. **Self-Inventory**: Ask the RUACH HAQODESH to reveal open doorways
2. **Repent Specifically**: Use the micro-liturgy for closing doorways
3. **Guard Your Life**: Don''t reopen what YAHUAH has sealed
4. **Walk in Authority**: You''re not a victim—you''re a warrior',

  '## About This Song

**Remnant Anthem** is a declaration of identity for those who refuse to compromise. It''s a battle cry for the last-days believers who walk in holiness, honor the sacred Names, and stand firm in the face of opposition.

## Lyrics

*Verse 1:*  
We are the remnant, called and set apart  
Fire in our spirit, YAHUAH in our heart  
No more religion, no more playing games  
We speak the truth and honor His Name  

*Chorus:*  
YAHUSHA is King, the Lion has roared  
We take up our cross, we unsheathe the sword  
The enemy trembles when we stand and fight  
Covered in His blood, walking in the light  

*Verse 2:*  
They call us radical, they say we''ve gone too far  
But we won''t bow to Babylon or follow a fallen star  
We keep the Feasts, we guard the door  
We''re soldiers of the King, we''re made for war  

*Bridge:*  
By His blood we overcome  
By the word of our testimony  
We love not our lives unto death  
We are the remnant, we have no fear left  

## Musical Style

Powerful, anthemic worship with a war room edge. Think Hillsong meets hardcore—unapologetic, bold, and drenched in the RUACH HAQODESH.

## Inspiration

This song was born out of frustration with watered-down worship. We needed a sound that matched the intensity of these last days. A sound that calls believers to **wake up, stand up, and fight**.

## Scripture Foundation

- **Revelation 12:11** - "And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death."
- **Romans 8:37** - "Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us."
- **2 Timothy 2:3** - "You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."

## Use This Song

- **Corporate Worship**: Declare victory over the enemy
- **Personal Prayer Time**: Armor up before you face the day
- **Spiritual Warfare**: Use it as a weapon against the enemy
- **Encouragement**: Remind yourself of your identity in YAHUSHA',
