            <strong class="text-amber-200">YAHUAH</strong> - The personal Name of the Most High God, 
            often replaced with "LORD" in most English Bibles. The tetragrammaton (YHWH) restored.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-amber-200">YAHUSHA</strong> - The true Hebrew Name of the Messiah, 
            often translated as "Jesus" but originally meaning "YAHUAH saves."
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-amber-200">RUACH HAQODESH</strong> - The Holy Spirit, 
            literally "the Set-Apart Spirit" in Hebrew.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="text-amber-200">Elohim</strong> - The Hebrew word for God/gods, 
            used when referring to the divine nature or majesty.

        <h3 class="text-amber-100 font-bold mb-2">Why This Matters</h3>
        <p class="text-neutral-300 text-sm">
          Names have power and meaning. The Name of YAHUAH was hidden for centuries through translation. 
          When we restore the sacred Names, we honor Him as He revealed Himself to His people. 
          This is not about legalismâ€”it's about relationship and reverence.
