        Prayer and fasting are not optional disciplines—they are essential weapons in the arsenal of every believer who desires to walk in power and authority.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why Prayer & Fasting?</h2>
      <p>
        YAHUSHA Himself said that some things only come out through prayer and fasting (Matthew 17:21). When you fast, you deny the flesh and sharpen your spiritual senses. You become more sensitive to the voice of the RUACH HAQODESH.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Types of Fasts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Water Fast:</strong> No food, only water. The most powerful form of fasting.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial Fast:</strong> Abstaining from certain foods (e.g., the Daniel Fast).</li>
        <li><strong>Media Fast:</strong> Disconnecting from entertainment and distractions to focus on YAHUAH.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Power of Prayer</h2>
      <p>
        Prayer is your direct line to the throne room of YAHUAH. It's not about eloquent words—it's about a sincere heart. Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Practical Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Set aside specific times each day for prayer</li>
        <li>Begin with a fast—even if it's just one meal</li>
        <li>Keep a prayer journal to track what YAHUAH is saying</li>
        <li>Pray in the Spirit (Romans 8:26)</li>
        <li>Don't just ask—worship and listen</li>
      </ol>
