        Your identity is not found in the world, in your job, or in your relationships. Your identity is found in YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH—the Anointed One.

      <h2>Who Is YAHUSHA?</h2>
      <p>
        YAHUSHA (often called Jesus) is the Messiah—the promised One sent to redeem humanity from sin. He is the Word made flesh, the Son of YAHUAH, fully God and fully man. He lived a sinless life, died on the cross for our sins, and rose again on the third day.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Who Are You in Him?</h2>
      <p>
        When you accept YAHUSHA as your Savior and Lord, you are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A New Creation:</strong> The old has passed away; the new has come (2 Corinthians 5:17)</li>
        <li><strong>A Child of YAHUAH:</strong> Adopted into the family of God (Romans 8:15)</li>
        <li><strong>Righteous:</strong> Made righteous through the blood of YAHUSHA (2 Corinthians 5:21)</li>
        <li><strong>An Ambassador:</strong> Representing the Kingdom of Heaven on earth (2 Corinthians 5:20)</li>
        <li><strong>Seated in Heavenly Places:</strong> Your position is secure in Him (Ephesians 2:6)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Walk in Your Identity</h2>
      <p>
        Stop seeing yourself through the lens of your past, your failures, or your weaknesses. See yourself as YAHUAH sees you—washed, sanctified, and justified in the Name of YAHUSHA.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Call to Holiness</h2>
      <p>
        Your identity in Mashiach demands a response: holiness. Be holy as He is holy (1 Peter 1:16). Separate yourself from the world. Walk in purity, integrity, and obedience.
