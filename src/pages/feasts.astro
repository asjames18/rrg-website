        The Feasts of YAHUAH are not "Jewish holidays"—they are His appointed times, given to all His people as eternal ordinances.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Why the Feasts Matter</h2>
      <p>
        Leviticus 23 lays out seven appointed feasts. These are not suggestions or cultural traditions—they are commanded observances that reveal the redemptive plan of YAHUAH through YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Seven Feasts</h2>
      <h3>Spring Feasts (Already Fulfilled)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Passover (Pesach):</strong> YAHUSHA died as our Passover Lamb</li>
        <li><strong>Unleavened Bread:</strong> Walk in purity, removing sin from our lives</li>
        <li><strong>First Fruits:</strong> YAHUSHA resurrected as the first fruits of the dead</li>
        <li><strong>Pentecost (Shavuot):</strong> The RUACH HAQODESH poured out</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Fall Feasts (Yet to Be Fulfilled)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trumpets (Yom Teruah):</strong> The rapture and gathering of the elect</li>
        <li><strong>Atonement (Yom Kippur):</strong> The Day of Atonement and judgment</li>
        <li><strong>Tabernacles (Sukkot):</strong> Dwelling with YAHUAH in the Millennial Kingdom</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>How to Observe</h2>
      <p>
        Start by learning the biblical calendar. Celebrate these feasts with your family. Study their prophetic significance. Allow the RUACH HAQODESH to reveal deeper truths as you honor His appointed times.
