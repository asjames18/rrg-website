        We are living in the last days. The signs are all around us. The question is: are you ready for the return of YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH?
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Signs of the Times</h2>
      <p>
        YAHUSHA warned us to watch and be ready. We see the signs unfolding before our eyes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wars and rumors of wars (Matthew 24:6)</li>
        <li>Earthquakes in various places (Matthew 24:7)</li>
        <li>False prophets deceiving many (Matthew 24:11)</li>
        <li>The love of many growing cold (Matthew 24:12)</li>
        <li>The gospel preached to all nations (Matthew 24:14)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The Tribulation</h2>
      <p>
        A time of great tribulation is coming—a time of trouble such as the world has never seen (Matthew 24:21). But those who endure to the end will be saved.
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Return of Mashiach</h2>
      <p>
        YAHUSHA is coming back. Not as a suffering servant, but as a conquering King. Every eye will see Him (Revelation 1:7). Are you ready?
      </p>
      
      <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Repent:</strong> Turn from sin and walk in holiness</li>
        <li><strong>Watch:</strong> Stay alert and discerning</li>
        <li><strong>Pray:</strong> Intercede for the lost and for the remnant</li>
        <li><strong>Endure:</strong> Hold fast to your faith, no matter the cost</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the Gospel:</strong> Time is short—share the Good News</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>The Hope We Have</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, dark days are ahead. But we do not lose hope. Our hope is in YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH, who has overcome the world. He is coming to establish His Kingdom, and we will reign with Him forever.
