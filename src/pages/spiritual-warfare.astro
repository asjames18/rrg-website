        We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers, rulers of darkness, and spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12).
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Reality of the Battle</h2>
      <p>
        Make no mistake—there is a real enemy, and he prowls around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). But greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4).
      </p>
      
      <h2>The Armor of YAHUAH</h2>
      <p>
        Ephesians 6:13-18 commands us to put on the full armor of YAHUAH:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Belt of Truth:</strong> Stand firm in the Word of YAHUAH</li>
        <li><strong>Breastplate of Righteousness:</strong> Walk in holiness and obedience</li>
        <li><strong>Shoes of the Gospel of Peace:</strong> Be ready to share the Good News</li>
        <li><strong>Shield of Faith:</strong> Quench every fiery dart of the enemy</li>
        <li><strong>Helmet of Salvation:</strong> Guard your mind with the assurance of salvation</li>
        <li><strong>Sword of the Spirit:</strong> Wield the Word of YAHUAH as your offensive weapon</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer:</strong> Pray always in the Spirit</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Authority in YAHUSHA</h2>
      <p>
        You have been given authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19). Use the Name of YAHUSHA. Resist the devil, and he will flee (James 4:7).
      </p>
      
      <h2>Practical Warfare</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Start your day with prayer and putting on the armor</li>
        <li>Plead the blood of YAHUSHA over your life, family, and home</li>
        <li>Speak the Word of YAHUAH out loud—it's a sword</li>
        <li>Fast to break strongholds</li>
        <li>Walk in discernment and test every spirit</li>
      </ol>
