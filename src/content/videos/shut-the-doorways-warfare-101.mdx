## Overview

The enemy doesn't need permission to attack—but he does need an open door. In this teaching, we break down the most common doorways that give the adversary legal access to your life.

## What You'll Learn

- **Identifying Open Doors**: Unforgiveness, sexual sin, occult involvement, generational curses
- **Closing the Access**: Biblical repentance and renunciation
- **Guarding the Seal**: How to keep doors shut once they're closed
- **Authority in YAHUSHA**: Using the Name above all names

## Key Points

### 1. Every Doorway Has a Key
The enemy can't just barge in. He exploits:
- Sin you haven't repented of
- Trauma you haven't surrendered
- Agreements you've made (knowingly or unknowingly)

### 2. Repentance Closes Doors
It's not enough to feel bad about sin. You have to:
- Confess it (agree with YAHUAH that it's sin)
- Renounce it (break agreement with darkness)
- Receive forgiveness (plead the blood of YAHUSHA)

### 3. The Blood Seals It
Once you've closed a door, plead the blood of YAHUSHA over it. Command the enemy to leave in YAHUSHA's Name. Then station the RUACH HAQODESH as your guard.

## Watch This If...

- You feel spiritually attacked but don't know why
- You've repented but still feel oppressed
- You want to learn how to fight with spiritual authority
- You're tired of living defensively and want to go on offense

## Action Steps After Watching

1. **Self-Inventory**: Ask the RUACH HAQODESH to reveal open doorways
2. **Repent Specifically**: Use the micro-liturgy for closing doorways
3. **Guard Your Life**: Don't reopen what YAHUAH has sealed
4. **Walk in Authority**: You're not a victim—you're a warrior
