## Why This Book?

Most Christians have been taught a sanitized, Greco-Roman version of the faith. This handbook strips away centuries of tradition and brings you back to the **Hebrew foundations** of Scripture.

## What You'll Discover

### The Sacred Names
- Why "LORD" isn't a name—it's a title that replaced the Tetragrammaton
- The true Name of the Father: **YAHUAH**
- The true Name of the Messiah: **YAHUSHA**
- The power and significance of speaking His Name

### The Torah Is Not Dead
- How the law was never abolished—only fulfilled in YAHUSHA
- What it means to walk in obedience without legalism
- The difference between Pharisaical tradition and YAHUAH's commands

### The Feasts of YAHUAH
- Why the biblical calendar matters
- The prophetic significance of each Feast
- How to observe them in a modern context
- The Fall Feasts and the return of YAHUSHA

### Identity & Covenant
- Who is Israel? (Hint: It's not just about ethnicity)
- The grafting in of Gentile believers
- One new man in Mashiach

## Who Should Read This?

- Believers who sense something is missing in traditional Christianity
- Anyone curious about the Hebrew roots of the faith
- Those who want to honor YAHUAH with His true Name
- People seeking to understand the Feasts and biblical calendar

## What Readers Are Saying

*"This book challenged everything I thought I knew about Christianity. I'm not the same person after reading it."*

*"Finally, a resource that doesn't compromise on truth. The Sacred Names section alone is worth the price."*

*"If you're serious about walking with YAHUAH, you need this book."*

## Our Take

This handbook is a solid introduction to Hebraic roots without the fluff. It's direct, biblically grounded, and practical. 

**Fair Warning:** This book will challenge you. If you're comfortable in your current theology, this might shake you. But if you're hungry for truth and willing to be refined, this is essential reading.
