## Daily Preparation

Every morning, before you face the world, put on the full armor of YAHUAH (Ephesians 6:11).

This isn't a metaphor. This isn't symbolic. This is your spiritual covering against the enemy's attacks.

## The Six Pieces

### 1. Belt of Truth
**Stand firm in the Word of YAHUAH.** Lies cannot penetrate truth. When the enemy whispers doubt, counter with Scripture. When he questions your identity, declare who you are in YAHUSHA.

### 2. Breastplate of Righteousness
**Walk in holiness.** Guard your heart from compromise. The enemy targets your heart—your emotions, your desires, your affections. Righteousness protects your core.

### 3. Shoes of the Gospel of Peace
**Be ready to share the Good News.** Move in His authority. You're not running from the enemy—you're advancing His Kingdom. Every step should declare the Gospel.

### 4. Shield of Faith
**Quench every fiery dart.** The enemy will shoot arrows of doubt, fear, and condemnation. Your faith in YAHUAH's promises is your shield. Trust His Word over your feelings.

### 5. Helmet of Salvation
**Guard your mind.** Know your position in YAHUSHA is secure. The enemy attacks your thoughts—your identity, your worth, your purpose. The helmet protects your mind with the truth of your salvation.

### 6. Sword of the Spirit
**Wield the Word of YAHUAH.** This is your offensive weapon. It's sharp, living, and powerful. Use it to cut through lies and declare truth.

## The Authority You Have

You have been given authority to trample on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy (Luke 10:19).

Use the Name of YAHUSHA. Resist the devil, and he will flee (James 4:7).

## The Daily Routine

Every morning:
1. **Put on the armor** - Declare each piece over your life
2. **Take up the shield** - Choose faith over fear
3. **Take the sword** - Fill your mind with Scripture
4. **Pray in the Spirit** - Let the RUACH HAQODESH guide your prayers

## The Challenge

Don't go into battle unarmed. Don't face the enemy unprepared.

**Put on the full armor of YAHUAH, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil (Ephesians 6:11).**

The enemy doesn't take days off. Neither should you.
