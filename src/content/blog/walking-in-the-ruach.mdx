## The Power Within

You have the same Spirit that raised YAHUSHA from the dead living inside you (Romans 8:11). 

Let that sink in.

The RUACH HAQODESH isn't a gentle breeze or a warm feeling. He's the raw power of YAHUAH. The same power that:
- Created the universe
- Parted the Red Sea
- Raised the dead
- Lives in you

## Yielding vs. Striving

Most believers are striving when they should be yielding. They're trying to be holy when they should be letting the Holy One work through them.

**Yielding means:**
- Daily surrender of your will
- Immediate obedience to His promptings
- Trusting His timing over your plans
- Letting Him lead, even when it doesn't make sense

## The Three Questions

Ask yourself these every morning:

1. **Am I yielded?** - Have I surrendered my agenda to YAHUAH today?
2. **Am I listening?** - Am I creating space to hear the RUACH HAQODESH?
3. **Am I obeying?** - When He speaks, do I act immediately?

## The Fruit Will Follow

When you walk in the Spirit, His fruit manifests naturally:
- Love that sacrifices
- Joy that endures trials
- Peace that surpasses understanding
- Patience that waits on YAHUAH's timing
- Kindness that serves others
- Goodness that reflects YAHUAH's character
- Faithfulness that never wavers
- Gentleness that speaks truth in love
- Self-control that masters the flesh

## The Challenge

Stop trying to be spiritual. Start being yielded.

The RUACH HAQODESH will do through you what you could never do on your own. He'll give you words when you don't know what to say. He'll give you strength when you're weak. He'll give you wisdom when you're confused.

**Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh (Galatians 5:16).**
