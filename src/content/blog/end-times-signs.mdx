## The Signs Are Unfolding

YAHUSHA told us to watch. He gave us specific signs to look for. And they're happening right now:

- **Wars and rumors of wars** (Matthew 24:6)
- **Earthquakes in various places** (Matthew 24:7)
- **False prophets deceiving many** (Matthew 24:11)
- **The love of many growing cold** (Matthew 24:12)
- **The gospel preached to all nations** (Matthew 24:14)

## The Hour is Late

We're not in the end times—we're in the last of the last days. The birth pangs are intensifying. The contractions are getting closer together.

**The question isn't if YAHUSHA is coming back. The question is: are you ready?**

## Watch and Work

YAHUSHA told us to watch and work until He returns. Here's your assignment:

### Watch
- **Discern the times** - Don't be caught sleeping
- **Stay alert** - The enemy prowls like a roaring lion
- **Know the signs** - Study Scripture, not social media
- **Pray without ceasing** - Stay connected to YAHUAH

### Work
- **Share the Gospel** - The fields are white for harvest
- **Make disciples** - Train others in the ways of YAHUAH
- **Stand firm** - Don't compromise when persecution comes
- **Endure to the end** - He who endures will be saved

## The Tribulation is Coming

A time of great tribulation is coming—a time of trouble such as the world has never seen (Matthew 24:21).

But those who call on the Name of YAHUAH will be saved. Those who endure will reign with Him.

## The Return of the King

YAHUSHA is coming back. Not as a suffering servant, but as a conquering King.

- **Every eye will see Him** (Revelation 1:7)
- **The trumpet will sound** (1 Thessalonians 4:16)
- **The dead in Mashiach will rise** (1 Corinthians 15:52)
- **The remnant will be gathered** (Matthew 24:31)

## The Challenge

**Are you ready?**

- Repent. Turn from sin. Walk in holiness.
- Watch. Work. Endure.
- The hour is late, but the promise is sure: YAHUSHA HAMASHIACH is coming back.

Don't get caught sleeping. Don't be found wanting. 

**Be ready.**
