## Why Unleavened Bread Matters

Leaven represents sin. It puffs up. It spreads. It corrupts the whole lump (1 Corinthians 5:6). 

When YAHUAH commanded His people to eat unleavened bread for seven days, He wasn't making suggestions. He was establishing a pattern: **separate yourself from sin**.

## The Seven-Day Purge

For seven days, you remove all leaven from your house. Every crumb. Every trace. 

This is a physical act with spiritual meaning:

1. **Identify the leaven** - What sin is hiding in your life?
2. **Remove it ruthlessly** - No compromise, no "just a little"
3. **Guard the house** - Stay vigilant so it doesn't return

## Modern Application

We're not under the law for salvation—we're under grace. But grace doesn't mean license to sin. It means power to overcome.

The Feast of Unleavened Bread teaches us:

- **Holiness is intentional** - You have to actively remove sin
- **Small compromises spread** - A little leaven corrupts the whole
- **Obedience brings freedom** - Living without leaven is living without burden

## The Challenge

This year, don't just skip Easter and call it done. **Observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread.**

- Fast from a specific sin for seven days
- Remove ungodly influences from your home (media, relationships, habits)
- Meditate on YAHUSHA as the Bread of Life—pure, sinless, unleavened

YAHUAH didn't give us the Feasts to burden us. He gave them to train us, refine us, and prepare us for His Kingdom.

Keep the Feast. Dump the yeast. Walk in holiness.
